         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TheÅ¿e men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>monly made their recourÅ¿e to London weekely, who might haue beene Å¿tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers one to another in regard of their diÅ¿tance in dwelling, yet proued brethren by reaÅ¿on of their profeÅ¿Å¿ion.

WhileÅ¿t this courÅ¿e continued the trade flouriÅ¿hed, and Gods bleÅ¿Å¿ing abounded on all dealers therein: But corrupting time (more apt in Å¿tooping to vice than mounting to vertue) not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected Å¿ome of this Fraternitie with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of deceit, but alÅ¿o Å¿tirred other intruders in this trade, who greedie of Å¿uch apparent gaine, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the well deÅ¿eruers, vÅ¿urped the name of Clothiers, without the knowledge of the true courÅ¿e, but well Å¿tudied in fraud, which practiÅ¿e they intended Å¿hould Å¿upply their want of knowledge, to equal that gaine formerly obtained, more reÅ¿pecting their preÅ¿ent profit than all future good, nor making conÅ¿cience of the meanes, Å¿o they poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿t the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

If lawleÅ¿Å¿e libertie were allowable wee Å¿hould not differ from beaÅ¿ts, nor diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h good from bad: our reaÅ¿on and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion leads vs to better knowledge, and daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods fauour towards truth Å¿hould draw vs to imbrace it.</p>
               <p>We haue a preÅ¿ident within this Realme to lead vs to a true courÅ¿e from that nation which were our firÅ¿t tutors to the trade, who now make a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie among vs of our Woolls; which, by reaÅ¿on of their Å¿lightneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿mall value, might be eÅ¿teemed vnworthie of wearing, yet by their good obÅ¿erua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in making, Å¿earching, and Å¿ealing, it is Å¿o vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and maintained, that it is more vendible than any cloth we make, and Å¿o farre voyd of deceit, that any man, although vnskilfull, may buy it without preiudice or loÅ¿Å¿e. Looke into their liues and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, you Å¿hall find them religious towards God, dutifull to our Prince, louing one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and harmeleÅ¿Å¿e to all men, onely enemies to fraud and idleneÅ¿Å¿e, which they doe not onely hate in others, but puniÅ¿h Å¿euerely in themÅ¿elues. They keepe together, and diÅ¿perÅ¿e not in many places, to the end one gouernement Å¿hall rule them; but in two places within this Realme doe they make their congregations,<note place="margin">Sandwich and Colchester.</note> where it were a wonder to behold, Å¿o many people to maintaine themÅ¿elues on Å¿o
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20863:7"/>flight a trade, yet neuer a begger amongÅ¿t them. They haue no Statute Law to bind them, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elues, which are Å¿o duely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, without partialitie, that their rich are not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured, nor their poore oppreÅ¿Å¿ed. Their Å¿earch in that commoditie is threefold, one from the Loome, one from the milling, or thickening, and one from the dreÅ¿Å¿ing; and where offence is made, there pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment is Å¿ure. What would theÅ¿e people doe if they had the making &amp; ordering of our rich clothes of great value, that can bring Å¿uch Å¿light ware in that eÅ¿timation? But as wee are farre from inuenting good, Å¿o are we vnapt to imitate it, though neuer Å¿o plainely taught vs before our eyes.</p>
               <p>It hath beene Å¿eene that a foreine cloth being made, and not falling out to the full goodneÅ¿Å¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the maker hath affixed a peece of Å¿iluer to that peece, of Å¿uch value as Å¿hould counteruaile the want of worth: But we are more readie in greedie manner to take away from a cloth, when it is too bad before.</p>
               <p>Now as herein the Clothier and maker is taxed, the Marchants and buyer cannot eÅ¿cape vntouched; For as there are good of both Å¿orts (whoÅ¿e number are too few) Å¿o there are extreame bad (which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amendment, might be well Å¿pared): There is no more difference betweene a bad Clothier and a bad Merchant, than betweene a theefe and his receiuer; for as the one commits vnlawfull crimes, the other maintaines it by concealements, nay more, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20863:8"/>him thereunto. Many Merchants are of that diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, that they more reÅ¿pect their preÅ¿ent gain than the good of all others, looking vpon the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and not on the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of what they buy; caÅ¿ting vpon their gaine of mony, and not on their gaine of credit, whereas both might eaÅ¿ily be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Let a Clothier haue a new trick of deceit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to law, and preiudiciall to the generall good, if it may be a particular profit, although not dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that man Å¿halbe Å¿ure of entertainement: if hee feare diÅ¿couerie, or to bee caught by the law, theÅ¿e Merchants haue infinit deuiÅ¿es to make it walke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiÅ¿ible; if <hi>Argus</hi> eyes were watchfull ouer them, yet haue they miÅ¿ts to blind them all: But God, who is the vpholder of truth, wil one day bring theÅ¿e hidden miÅ¿chiefes to light, and turne this wicked gaine to Å¿hame and loÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the making of Cloth within this Land, the Alneger was ordained, who exerciÅ¿ed that office vpon al cloths com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from foreine parts, to meaÅ¿ure and trie them where they were put on la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of his name Alneger Å¿hewes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his office as onely meaÅ¿urer appointed.<note place="margin">2. Ed. 3, cap. 14.</note> For a long time his authoritie was caried by proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before any Parliament was holden: his fee was not then giuen him, but allowance from the Lord TreaÅ¿urer and Barons of EÅ¿chequer, according to his paines and care: his charge was to Å¿ee all clothes of aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿e marked, and thoÅ¿e not of aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿e and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue, to bee taken into his hands for the King,<note place="margin">2. Ed. 3. cap. 14.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the preÅ¿ence of any Maior, Bailife, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magiÅ¿trate, wherein his credit and truÅ¿t repoÅ¿ed by the King was explaned.</p>
               <p>When the making of thoÅ¿e Clothes were drawne hither, and dayly increaÅ¿ed, the King found great loÅ¿Å¿e in his cuÅ¿tomes; for that the wools of thoÅ¿e Clothes being before tranÅ¿ported, did yeeld much cuÅ¿tome, and the like anÅ¿wered vpon returne
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20863:9"/>of the Cloth, which double benefit to the king was loÅ¿t, although it brought much good to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth by the Å¿ubjects imployment. Vpon due conÅ¿ideration hereof, a Å¿ubÅ¿idie was graunted vnto the king and his Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ours vpon all Clothes made within the Realme, foure pence vpon euerie cloth, and two pence on euerie halfe Cloth: beÅ¿ides, a SubÅ¿idie vpon all graine colours,<note place="margin">27. E. 3. cap. 14.</note> as appeareth by that Statute at large: the collection whereof was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Alneger, as the moÅ¿t fitteÅ¿t man for it, being the kings onely officer for thoÅ¿e affaires: at which times he had alÅ¿o his fee of a halfepenie on euerie Cloth giuen him, with a reÅ¿eruation of all his former power and charge both for the king and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of abuÅ¿es.</p>
               <p>Now it is to be conÅ¿idered what value a halfepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie was in thoÅ¿e dayes, and what the Å¿eruice was to be performed for it: All the paynes he tooke, was but to caÅ¿t a Lyne of Å¿euen yards foure times ouer the Cloth in length, and to meaÅ¿ure the bredth then appointed, which he continued a long time: then were the faults but few, and eaÅ¿ily-Å¿uppreÅ¿t; but in time grew like <hi>Hydras</hi> heads, in cutting off one, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Å¿prung vp in the Å¿tead, that the defects num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Å¿o faÅ¿t vpon him, as put him to endleÅ¿Å¿e trouble.</p>
               <p>And in regard his place Å¿tood vpon two diÅ¿tinct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the one to collect the SuÅ¿idie, wherein was no farthing charge; the other was the executing of the Alnage, which tied him by great penalties to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20863:9"/>truely: he finding the paines Å¿o much to make reformation in Å¿o many defects, and of Å¿uch diuerÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with his fee too Å¿mall to counteruaile his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and trouble, did voluntarily forgoe the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his office, and onely betooke himÅ¿elfe to the collection of the SubÅ¿idie: and hauing two Seales appointed him Å¿euerally, one with the kings armes for the SubÅ¿idie, the other with the true content and Å¿earch for the Alnage, he would afterward onely Å¿et on the kings Å¿eale, leauing his Å¿earch and fee, to be freed of his prejudice; which neglect of his gaue way to thoÅ¿e which practiÅ¿ed thoÅ¿e deceipts, and in time grew to that highth, as the whole common wealth felt the Å¿mart thereof; and forced all Å¿orts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning to thoÅ¿e trades to Å¿eeke for redreÅ¿Å¿e, and to make Å¿euere Lawes for the puniÅ¿hment of thoÅ¿e deceits, appointing Å¿earchers and ouer-Å¿eers for that purpoÅ¿e, with diuers orders concerning the Å¿ame; and perceiuing that the Å¿mall fee of the Alneger cauÅ¿ed him to neglect the Å¿earch, the fee was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented from a halfepenie to two pence, and Å¿o for a time carefully executed: but the former miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, which cauÅ¿ed the prouiÅ¿ion of thoÅ¿e Lawes and orders, in Å¿hort time crept in againe, more daungerous, and the office of Å¿earch worÅ¿e exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with the fee of two pence than before with the Alnegers farthing: better it were Å¿uch Å¿earch Å¿hould bee forborne, than Å¿o faÅ¿lly perfourmed, nor will it euer be truely executed but by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, who hath euer brought all queÅ¿tions and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20863:10"/>puniÅ¿hment vpon all faults yet brought to light. The Alneger is fitteÅ¿t for that place conÅ¿idering his credit and truÅ¿t with the Kings Seale, which hee is made Chauncellor of for that purpoÅ¿e, and that all the imputation of falÅ¿e Cloth and falÅ¿e Å¿ealing is laid vpon it; Å¿o that both our nation and our Kings imperiall armes are Å¿candalized in all foreine parts. How carefull haue former Kings been to haue the Alneger Å¿ufficient in all points:<note place="margin">1. R. 3. cap. 8.</note> FirÅ¿t to bee expert in knowledge, then Å¿ufficient in wealth, and that no Alneger of any Countie or Citie Å¿hould bee leÅ¿Å¿e worth than an hundred pounds, if hee were of Å¿uch value, to the King; and in thoÅ¿e daies his credit was little inferiour to moÅ¿t of the IuÅ¿tices where hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode: Then had hee his priuiledge to make his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts but once a yeare, whatÅ¿oeuer was in his hands: And Å¿o fauoured, to paÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e accomps in his highneÅ¿Å¿e EÅ¿chequer, without charge or fee: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides he muÅ¿t be the Kings naturall Å¿ubiect, no alien to bee permitted thereunto. This was intended for thoÅ¿e that did execute the place: but for thoÅ¿e which Å¿hould receiue the reuenue and profits royall, choiÅ¿e hath been made of Å¿uch, as appeares vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that the Queen of this Realme and the duke of Buckingham hath been intereÅ¿Å¿ed therein for Å¿ome part of the Kingdome. And in euerie Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where Å¿tatutes were ordained, the Alnegers power and priuiledge Å¿till preÅ¿erued: this charge, credit, truÅ¿t, and prouiÅ¿ion muÅ¿t of force drawe his care beyond thoÅ¿e Å¿light Å¿earchers of Å¿mall credit:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20863:10"/>But the offendors and thoÅ¿e which practiÅ¿e deceit, thinke the Alneger too buÅ¿ie in his place, Å¿eeking to Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e, his power by all meanes they can. There was of late yeres a notorious felo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> within this realm, who hauing committed many vnlawfull outrages, and deÅ¿irous to continue Å¿o, would haue the Lord chiefe IuÅ¿tice bound to the peace, offering to take his othe that hee did not onely Å¿eeke to depriue him of his meanes of liuing but alÅ¿o Å¿ought his life; Å¿o if they could bind the Alneger to the peace, they could make a trade of falÅ¿hood without controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But by too much Å¿ufferance of this hurt, the common wealth is wounded, the beÅ¿t Å¿ort Å¿eeking meanes to heale it, but they like gald-backe Iades, kicke at thoÅ¿e which come to cure them. The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Å¿nuffers of the law is put into the Alnegers hand, who muÅ¿t make vÅ¿e of them, and howÅ¿oeuer they Å¿nuffe, hee will Å¿nuffe too, and cleere the light which Å¿hall Å¿hew them the way to trueth. In this he Å¿hall Å¿tirre vp the Å¿ting of enuious tongues whoÅ¿e venome cannot hurt him, but procure the praiers of the beÅ¿t which Å¿hall receiue comfort thereby.</p>
               <p>The moÅ¿t reuerent Diuine, if he touch the finnes of the wicked to the quick, Å¿hall Å¿ooner moue them to railing than to reformation, but the malice of euil people is not to be regarded. Here might queÅ¿tion bee made, wherefore the Alneger Å¿hould now Å¿tirre more than of late times: It was his vÅ¿uall courÅ¿e, to take his money for the Å¿eale and Å¿o to bee quiet: Why Å¿hould he trouble himÅ¿elfe with Å¿uch labour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20863:11"/>that will breed enuie to him, and vexation to others. It muÅ¿t be aunÅ¿wered that although hee hath long time lyen a Å¿leepe, the neceÅ¿Å¿itie of the time, and loud clamours of abuÅ¿es hath awakt him. His charge and duetie to the office, his Å¿eruice to the King, his maintenaunce of the trade that muÅ¿t mayntaine him, and benefit to the common wealth, Å¿ets him on foot to performe that which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can doe: wherein hee will ay me at two things, the general good, and his priuat profit. Since his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance much power and profit hath been drawne from him by vÅ¿urpation, which he may eaÅ¿ily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as braunches pluckt from his bodie. The meaÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Å¿ilke, linnen, yea and of Å¿ome Å¿orts of wollen cloth, are made petty offices, and held by thoÅ¿e which haue no right thereunto. Euerie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour MagiÅ¿trate will take vpon him to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h offices, which Å¿hall contradict the appointment of the King and his Lawes. Who is the meaÅ¿urer of all Å¿aleable Clothes, or all commodities mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urable, but onely hee? not onely appointed by Å¿euerall Statutes, but alÅ¿o confirmed by the kings graunt by letters patents.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20863:11"/>and afterward in the fourteenth yere of his raigne to one Symond of Darlington, and alÅ¿o another patent for the Alnage of all manner of outlandiÅ¿h Cloth, to one Iohn Griffen in the Å¿euenteenth yere of his raigne, as may appeare vpon the Å¿euerall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in the Tower of London. If the Alneger did but a while forbeare his collection of the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idie alÅ¿o, Å¿ome forged authoritie would lay claime to that too; but Å¿ufferance cannot Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e right, the one office being as truely due as the other,<note place="margin">25.

As he may receiue both Å¿ubÅ¿idie and alnage vpon all Å¿orts of woollen commodities, Å¿o may hee receiue the alnage fee vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all other Å¿orts of Cloth and commodities mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urable and Å¿aleable, from the fineÅ¿t Å¿ilk to the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿t hempe: much of that due is taken in Å¿ome places fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> him, which muÅ¿t giue way when he pleaÅ¿e to take place: nor Å¿hall he need much difficultie to decide that right being Å¿o appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t &amp; plaine in his behalfe: at all times when queÅ¿tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> hath bin made of his right or power, the leaned Iudges of this la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d haue confirmed the Å¿ame, as appeareth by many Å¿eueral decrees.

For thoÅ¿e clothes which are Å¿ealed by them, the law directs their order, appointing the Å¿euerall penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on euerie fault, and how the Å¿ame Å¿hall bee diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed. If the MagiÅ¿trates or IuÅ¿tices of any place neglect the choiÅ¿e of Å¿uch Å¿earchers, then a penaltie is laid on them for that default: But this Å¿earch and orders are groÅ¿Å¿ely abuÅ¿ed in Å¿eueral kindes. In many places are no Å¿earchers at all appointed: In Å¿ome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20863:13"/>places the Clothiers and makers keepe a Å¿earched Å¿eale of their owne, to Å¿et on what they pleaÅ¿e: but in moÅ¿t places thoÅ¿e Å¿earchers choÅ¿en are vnÅ¿ufficient in knowledge to performe their place, or in ability to anÅ¿were the penalties; if they be of knowledge, then are they Å¿uch which be Å¿eruants, or workmen to thoÅ¿e Clothiers or makers which are the offenders, whom they dare not puniÅ¿h nor offend: and to auoide their breach of oath, will Å¿end boies or other like people to performe their place, and Å¿et on the Å¿eale; elÅ¿e will they lend that Å¿eale to euerie one which demands it, by which meanes they Å¿aue their oathes in Å¿eeing no faults, and for their bonds they prouide for the Å¿afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, by a combination betweene the Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; themÅ¿elues, none can challenge them, but thoÅ¿e which will keepe their counÅ¿ell; when any choiÅ¿e is to be made, then are the clothiers Å¿uiters to the IuÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Å¿uch men as they nominate, which are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne hearts, which requeÅ¿t of theirs is Å¿eldome denied: So there are often choÅ¿en Taylors, glouers, tanners, butchers, Å¿miths, or Å¿uch like, which haue no judgement at all in Cloth, nor the place. If malefactors of the Law might chuÅ¿e their Iudge and Iurie, they would Å¿eldome be caÅ¿t. The beÅ¿t Å¿earch made by the Å¿earchers in any place, is but to caÅ¿t the Clothes into Å¿kales to Å¿ee if they be weight or no, which if any do want, the clothier Å¿upplies that want with Å¿tones, bricks, lead, leaden weights, and other ponderous things which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>uey into light cloth to make it hold weight, which is eaÅ¿ily done in regard

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N diÅ¿couering of deceit, Å¿ome cauilling humour may obiect, it will rather Å¿erue for inÅ¿truction to farther practize than preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to future harme. It is aunÅ¿we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that thoÅ¿e practitioners in theÅ¿e abuÅ¿es are Å¿o deepely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced therein, beeing in common vÅ¿e of them, as all other wits can giue them no more direction. The purpoÅ¿e heere intended, is to vnmaske the face of falÅ¿hoode: which Å¿eemes that it is not, and to giue knowledge thereof to thoÅ¿e that are wronged. The art of Conycatching was a Å¿ecret MyÅ¿terie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a booke of diÅ¿couerie came forth, which could not teach them who were perfect in their leÅ¿Å¿on without booke, but cauÅ¿e the Å¿imple to Å¿ee, and the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t to Å¿hunne their Å¿ubtle Å¿nares prouided to catch their gulls. The cauÅ¿e heere handled is nothing inferiour to theirs in cunning, but much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them in preiudice, by the many more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which feele the Å¿mart therof; wiÅ¿hing this briefe relation might Å¿o effectually reueale the deceits, as it might publiquely bee knowne aÅ¿well no thoÅ¿e which indure the damage as them which commit
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20863:14"/>the crimes: and although euery particular fault can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee heere deÅ¿cribed, by reaÅ¿on of their numbers (which were too tedious) yet the principals Å¿hall bee touched vpon which the reÅ¿t depend: hee that Å¿eeth a tree may eaÅ¿ily viewe the bodie but hardly number the leaues, but the tree beeing fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the leaues Å¿oone die.</p>
               <p>Herewithall a difference muÅ¿t bee noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the opinion of Å¿ome people, and the true intent of the law. There are many Å¿orts of cloth or Å¿tuffes lately inuented, which haue got newe god fathers to name them in fantaÅ¿ticall faÅ¿hion, that they which weare them, know not how to name them, which are generally called newe draperie, what hold canne the lawe take of them? In the firÅ¿t lawe, the cloth raye was vnderÅ¿tood and colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red clothes what Å¿izes they Å¿hould contain in length and breadth; Å¿ince that time prouiÅ¿ion made by lawes, for broad clothes, kerÅ¿ies, dozens, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tones, cottons, and Å¿uch like to containe length, breadth, and weight appointed: but theÅ¿e new deuices are out of the reach of thoÅ¿e lawes, and free to bee made as it Å¿hall pleaÅ¿e the maker with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction. To anÅ¿were the Å¿ame, the brigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ground is to bee vnderÅ¿tood, the wooll paies Å¿ubÅ¿idie, and the leugth of euerie peece al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes alnage, and although the conuerting of wools (whoÅ¿e condition yields to diuers inuentions) be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from clothes to Å¿tuffes, Å¿hal the king loÅ¿e his Å¿ubÅ¿idy, or the Alneger his Å¿ee? no, it was long time
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20863:15"/>Å¿ince ordained by Å¿tatute, that all Å¿orts of clothes, although not of aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿e, Å¿hould pay Å¿ubÅ¿idie and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. And now of late yeres, the Å¿aid new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es are growne to that quantitie as the old Å¿ort of clothing is much impaired, and that greatly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, which is not to bee diÅ¿commended, in regard it vents our woolles, and imploies our people. But if gouernement and orders were not proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to maintaine it, in Å¿hort time wee Å¿hould find that as the Å¿ame had eaten out the auntient dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; Å¿o falÅ¿hood would ruyne that, and leaue the people without imployment. Why Å¿hould there bee a diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hment betweene old drapery and newe, when the law allowes but one draperie: As the condition of water may bee conueied diuers waies by riuers, Å¿prings, conduits, wells, pumpes, fountaines, pipes, ponds, and a number of Å¿euerall meanes, yet no alteration of the nature thereof; Å¿o may woolls bee conuerted into diuers properties: but yet the end and purpoÅ¿e of the Å¿ame, to Å¿erue mans vÅ¿e and wearing as broadcloth and auntient cloth did. If wee Å¿hould haue a new law for euerie new name of Å¿tuffe now made and named, the king muÅ¿t keepe a perpetuall Parliament to ordaine for them. There was of late a mad braind felowe which came by a company of workemen that were digging vp of a well to plant a pumpe in the place; hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded who Å¿et them a worke, they anÅ¿wered the parÅ¿on, churchwardens, and maiÅ¿ters of the pariÅ¿h; he replyed againe they vnderÅ¿tood not themÅ¿elues,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20863:15"/>for thereby they Å¿hould bee forced to alter their church booke, wherein it was written, PraiÅ¿e God all yee Å¿prings and wells, and now it muÅ¿t bee PraiÅ¿e God all yee Å¿prings and pumps; which fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous and vaine queÅ¿tion of his, may bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their exception, which will goe no farther then the word of the law, and neuer looke to the true intent of the Å¿ame.<note place="margin">39. El. cap. 20.</note> A Statute was lately made concerning the abuÅ¿es of clothes, wherein orders were prouided, that all Å¿orts of clothes Å¿hould be truely Å¿earched, and their iuÅ¿t contents of length and weight Å¿et vpon euerie peece with the word Å¿earched, vpon paine of forfeiture. This law inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the generall good and reformation of all: yet in regard there was but two counties nominated, or a certaine circuit expreÅ¿Å¿ed which did before time moÅ¿t offend in thoÅ¿e points; all offendors in other places would Å¿top that lawe from going any farther.<note place="margin">43.

The cauÅ¿e of this relation is to Å¿hew that Å¿ome of theÅ¿e old deceits are practiÅ¿ed in the new deuiÅ¿ed Å¿tuffe, wherefore as needefull to be reformed as the other; &amp; Å¿o proceede thereunto.</p>
               <p>Woolles beeing an excellent commoditie of it Å¿elfe, and naturally without deceit, is commonly abuÅ¿ed by mingling in diuers kinds,<note place="margin">Deceit in ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of woolles</note> Å¿ometime fleece wools, fell wooll, and lambs wooll which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie one to an other are put together, which makes the cloth vneuen, cockley, purÅ¿ey, baudy, and rewey.</p>
               <p>Then the mingling of fine floxe with long wools yet courÅ¿e, which beeing carded together doth holde Å¿pinning and working but moÅ¿t deceitfull in vÅ¿e and wearing. The vÅ¿e of Å¿hort thrums is likewiÅ¿e Å¿o ordered, which they take and Å¿hred into Å¿hort length, and then lay it in Å¿teepe in Å¿trong lye or liquor which openeth the threds into wooll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, then card it with other wooll which is worÅ¿e than the flox by making more vneuen in the Å¿pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:20863:16"/>This abuÅ¿e hath been put in practize Å¿o intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that it is certainely knowne clothes haue been made with two parts, floxe and thrums, and but one part in wooll; which hath Å¿eemed good to the eye, but in the wearing Å¿uch weake Å¿trength as would not endure a fourth part of time like the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit cloth. If any make queÅ¿tion, whether thoÅ¿e flox, thrums, or Å¿orts of wooll Å¿hould bee caÅ¿t away or not put to vÅ¿e: It is knowne that Å¿euerall Å¿orts of commodities are appointed wherein they may bee lawfully put to vÅ¿e, and verie vendible; but they with wicked purpoÅ¿e conuert them to great gaine, but greater hurt, worÅ¿e than caÅ¿ting droÅ¿Å¿e into fine gold, which is eaÅ¿ily found by the baÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e, and may bee purified againe, but this abuÅ¿e is like a poyÅ¿on not found till paÅ¿t cure.</p>

Å¿o that they know no end of their trouble, nor certaine of their gaine or loÅ¿Å¿e vntill their moneys be receiued, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements deducted. Bad wares are the breeders of bad debts and deÅ¿perat hazards, wherewith both Merchaunts and makers are extreamely puniÅ¿ht: when a complement of defectiue cloth is made, the owner is often inforced to barter for as bad a commoditie, a hilding for a Iade, or elÅ¿e to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it out with a handfull of that Å¿weet hearbe time, but receiue it with a backe burden of the bitter hearbe Rew. So heere is aduenture increaÅ¿ed, in which point the Merchant far exceeds the maker<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Yet the maker is an aduenturer, who hath his goods and Å¿ubÅ¿tance diÅ¿perÅ¿ed into many hands, yea and amongÅ¿t the poorer Å¿ort, of diuers conditions, whoÅ¿e fingers are like thornie buÅ¿hes which the Å¿heep muÅ¿t go through, in euerie of which, do what he can, he Å¿hall leaue a locke of his fleece behind him, and although he preÅ¿erue the principall, yet will a part be detained indirectly: Then when he hath with great care and time finiÅ¿ht his worke, he muÅ¿t vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe a doubtful Market, and often light on a bad mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, which defeats him of all: yet herein is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; for his worke folke, they are within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿e of his view, and Å¿eldome faile, by reaÅ¿on of their continual dependa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce; for his Markets he doth weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know his worÅ¿t; and for his Merchant, he may daily Å¿ee or beare from him at the Royal-Exchange,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20863:23"/>if his dealing be in London, &amp; in other places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realme in like manner. Wherefore, his fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards are but petie aduentures in regard of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
               <p>For when thoÅ¿e commodities are faÅ¿tned on the merchant, he muÅ¿t indure a number of dangerous aduentures, both outward and inward, Å¿hipwracks at Sea, peril of Pirats, and other robbers; at his place of Å¿ale, there he muÅ¿t giue credit to thoÅ¿e hee neuer Å¿aw, and Å¿uch as neither liue in his religion nor Law, he muÅ¿t abide to anÅ¿wer all defects found, where our owne Laws Å¿halbe alledged to puniÅ¿h them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not priuie to the offence.

TheÅ¿e and many other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ualties cauÅ¿eth cares to abridge his reÅ¿t, and keepes him waking when others Å¿leepe, euerie Å¿tormie wind breedes his feare, and euerie flying report makes him doubtfull, and not without great cauÅ¿e, Å¿eeing Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fall Å¿o lainly to the vtter ouerthrow, not onely of themÅ¿elues, but diuers other depending vpon them, like to the fall of a mightie Tree, which cruÅ¿heth downe the vnder Å¿hrubs about him, Å¿o farre as his fall did reach. Therefore the chiefe remedie to preuent much of this miÅ¿chiefe, is to deale in loyall and perfect commodities, which will with credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his time for Market, when the other by long
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20863:24"/>lying looÅ¿eth Å¿till, both in goodnes and credit; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing haÅ¿tie bargains, that brings after repentance. In Prouinces beyond the bounds of ChriÅ¿tendome, God is blaÅ¿phemed, our Religion reuiled, and our people miÅ¿tearmed in beaÅ¿tly manner: when a Turke or Infidell bruÅ¿heth his garment bare, that he may number the threeds, and find it to haue feeling fence to runne in at a wet Å¿howre, or a hot Iron, then our ChriÅ¿tian profeÅ¿Å¿ion is called in queÅ¿tion by thoÅ¿e prophane people, who meaÅ¿ure our faith by our works. In kingdomes nere vs, theÅ¿e abuÅ¿es haue been found Å¿o odious, and their people Å¿o much wronged, that they haue made lawes and edicts, to baniÅ¿h our cloth out of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tries, rather deÅ¿iring our wools, wherewith they can make true commodities.

When this kingdome was diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongÅ¿t Å¿euen kings, it was vnder a Å¿trange gouernement: when there was twiÅ¿e Å¿euen Alnegers in the realme, there was neither law nor order obÅ¿erued amongÅ¿t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>; but all they Å¿ought was gaine, and how to intrude into each others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: if a Clothier or offender were interrupted in his falÅ¿hood within one Countie, he could freely exerciÅ¿e the Å¿ame in another; where he Å¿hould be willingly receiued, becauÅ¿e he augmented that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negers profit. But now, thankes be to God, wee liue vnder one gratious Prince, who ordaines no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿itie of Lawes; but hath prouided one order of gouernement for all; So that ill diuided office of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage which ran to ruine in many hands, is now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into one worthie mans hands; which hath not only power to command, but alÅ¿o will to performe all meanes, and courÅ¿es, which may tend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of this grieuous enormitie: In this buÅ¿ines

The firÅ¿t thing to bee looked vnto, is the condition of the clothiers and makers of cloth, Å¿tuffes, and commodities belonging to this gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which at this time is much differing from law or order, many of them vnexperienced and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urpers of the trade, who not being maÅ¿ters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of through want of knowledge commit moÅ¿t of theÅ¿e abuÅ¿es. And whereas the law prouides that none which profeÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e trades Å¿hould bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnder Å¿euen yeares Å¿eruice in apprentiÅ¿hip, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers do come into the Å¿ame with a moneths practize, and cloies the Kingdome with defectiue commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, beggering themÅ¿elues, and hurting thoÅ¿e which Å¿hould liue by the Å¿ame: TheÅ¿e people for the moÅ¿t part dwelling in obÅ¿cure places, neuer bringing their commodities to Å¿earch or Å¿eale, nor yeelding any duetie, liue rather like outlawes than Å¿ubiects.

               <p>In the maner of this Å¿earch hee muÅ¿t obÅ¿erue the Å¿euerall penalties ordained by the law vpon all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, wherein hee muÅ¿t chiefely followe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Statute lately made in 4. <hi>Iacobi cap.</hi> 2. for length, breadth, and weight, of all Å¿orts of cloth,

The Alneger in euerie place muÅ¿t alÅ¿o keepe a booke for the King; wherein muÅ¿t bee regiÅ¿tred the Å¿euerall fines and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties taken in all theÅ¿e Å¿earches, for what, and from whom,<note place="margin">11.

               <p>And that the Alneger procure them to publique markets, eÅ¿pecially in London according to the Å¿tatut of 39. <hi>Eb. cap.</hi> 20. or elÅ¿e to lay the penaltie of that law on them, which is 40. s. vpon a cloth, and by all means to preuent priuat Å¿ales, which is the couer to hide all abuÅ¿es, &amp; eÅ¿cape due Å¿earch, &amp; therefore ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be obÅ¿erued.<note place="margin">Obiections.</note> In proÅ¿ecuting this order and courÅ¿e there will bee three maine obiections made, to Å¿ay, trouble, charge, and daunger: FirÅ¿t who will endure Å¿uch extraordinarie toile in carrying their goods Å¿o often to Å¿earch, and beeing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, farre off from the place of Å¿earch: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly who will yeeld-to Å¿uch a charge, as to the fees of a fourefold Å¿earch whereas heretofore neuer but one was required, and that fee hardly paid; this will be held a taxation or an impoÅ¿ition vnneceÅ¿Å¿arily
<pb facs="tcp:20863:29"/>drawne on, and good to bee auoided: Thirdly, who will run wilfully into the daunger of the lawe, as to abide the penalties which Å¿hall bee found out by Å¿o many Å¿earches, wherein euerie degree many offences are made. Wee cannot (Å¿ay they) caÅ¿t our cloth in a mould, but Å¿hall of force offend: rather then theÅ¿e hard conditions Å¿hould bee vndergone, euerie man will giue ouer clothing and betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe to other courÅ¿e of liuing, what Å¿hall then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the trade?<note place="margin">The AnÅ¿were.</note> To the firÅ¿t, the law requiers them to bee Å¿earched and further appoints them to bring their cloth to a citie, borough, or towne corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and there to bee Å¿earched and Å¿ealed where the Alneger or Å¿ealer Å¿hall bee, and place fitting: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides,<note place="margin">4. &amp; 5. P. &amp; M. cap. 5.</note> there is a vacant time commonly with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cloth betwixt each degree of Å¿earch: when a cloth comes forth of the loome, it goes not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently to the mill, nor Å¿o from the mill to dreÅ¿Å¿ing, neither from dreÅ¿Å¿ing to dying, but Å¿ometime a day or two, more or leÅ¿Å¿e lieth Å¿till, affording time for Å¿uch triall; but admit that all expedition therein may bee required, that time loÅ¿t is nothing bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿oone diÅ¿patched, neither will the paines Å¿eeme great to thoÅ¿e which intend trueth, better it is for them to endure a myles trauell, than the Merchants Å¿hould Å¿till vndergoe an endleÅ¿Å¿e trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, theier clothes often returned many hundred myles, and certificats daily which doth treble their loÅ¿Å¿e euerie way: whereas by this courÅ¿e they Å¿hall know their worÅ¿t at home, auoyd after-recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20863:29"/>and breed eaÅ¿e &amp; benefit to the merchants and themÅ¿elues. Secondly, for the charge that cannot be forborne, if the Å¿eruice be performed, conÅ¿idering this, that thoÅ¿e which doe the Å¿ame, are or ought to be of eÅ¿timation, profeÅ¿Å¿ors of that trade: wherefore, pretious is loÅ¿Å¿e of time, and that their paines duely done therin, deÅ¿erues no leÅ¿Å¿e fee, but eÅ¿pecially their danger of loÅ¿Å¿e, which will light on them, if their Å¿earch be falÅ¿e &amp; negligently performed. The charge of a bay, Å¿ealed at ColcheÅ¿ter (whoÅ¿e courÅ¿e herein muÅ¿t be imitated) by reaÅ¿on of the often Å¿earch it comes vnto ten pence duetie, yet diuers of them not aboue fortie Å¿hillings value: if this payment were left, their orders would fall, wherein they reape a fiue-fold benefit: Å¿o Å¿hall all Clothiers and makers find hereby, that if his cloth be defectiue, he Å¿hall know the worÅ¿t of his loÅ¿Å¿e, but if it be merchantable, thoÅ¿e Å¿eales Å¿hall be Å¿uch credit vnto it as Å¿hall much aduantage the Å¿ale thereof. Better is 8. pence giuen to haue a worke effectually done, than two pence to him that doth nothing at all, if any thing, rather hurt than good. The Å¿paring of this courÅ¿e, and theÅ¿e fees, hath beene the breeding of all former hurts; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the general good required it, yet euery mans priuat reÅ¿pect that Å¿hould perfome paines without profit, drew backe the meanes of remedie and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. 3. the daunager of Law cannot be diÅ¿penced withall to thoÅ¿e which wilfully breake the Law: it was ordained to be obÅ¿erued, yet moderadion will be herein vÅ¿ed and a difference made betweene faults
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20863:30"/>pretended, &amp; faults caÅ¿ual, &amp; the puniÅ¿hment in alÅ¿o inflicted, as Å¿hall rather tend to procure amendment, than the offenders ruine: and for offences generall, which are all lyable to the law, moÅ¿t of them by the makers care and officers Å¿earch will be Å¿uppreÅ¿t, and all in Å¿hort time by endeauours on all parts quite rooted out. That a doth cannot be caÅ¿t in a mould, it is true, but a clothier skilfull and carefull in choiÅ¿e of his wool and yame, and alÅ¿o perfect in his trade, may make a cloth as it pleaÅ¿eth himÅ¿elfe in length, bredth, euenneÅ¿Å¿e, and eÅ¿pecially in weight. We haue a Å¿ort of Clothiers which haue tolleration to Å¿traine, and whereas their clothes Å¿hould containe in weight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreÅ¿Å¿ed 60. l. the tolleration allowes them at 58. which comming all to the Alnegers triall, be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to them, pardons them at 56. which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing to incurre no daunger, vnleÅ¿Å¿e they be any thing vnder that weight, will bring them Å¿o juÅ¿t ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that in 20. clothes together, you Å¿hal Å¿carce find a quarter of a pound in any differing from 56. l. that indeed a man may judge they were caÅ¿t in a mould: theÅ¿e men could aÅ¿well make them to 58. l. but that they Å¿triue to decline, Å¿o farre as they can without danger. As for the diÅ¿couraging of people to deale in this trade, when Å¿o Å¿trict Å¿earch and order Å¿hal be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, neither the good clothier, nor the good Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, will Å¿ay Å¿o, nor the general opinion eÅ¿teeme it Å¿o: It was neuer knowne that true gouernment did at any time decay any trade, but rather cauÅ¿ed it to increaÅ¿e and flouriÅ¿h, by this meanes much more
<pb facs="tcp:20863:30"/>Cloth will be made, better Å¿ould, and more deÅ¿ired and Å¿ought for: and to conclude, Å¿upplie all neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wants, which this worthie (but ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wronged) trade hath long time indured.</p>
